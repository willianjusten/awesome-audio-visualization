- [What is Audio Visualization?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_visualization)

> Music visualization, a feature found in electronic music visualizers and media player software, generates animated imagery based on a piece of music. The imagery is usually generated and rendered in real time and in a way synchronized with the music as it is played.
